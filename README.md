Giri: Dynamic Program Slicing in LLVM
=====================================

_Dynamic program slicing_ is a technique that can precisely determine which instructions affected a particular value in a single execution of a program.

This project was firstly developed by [Sahoo, Swarup Kumar] (http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~ssahoo2/) and [John Criswell](http://www.bigw.org/~jcriswel) under [Vikram S. Adve](http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/~vadve/) from UIUC. It was selected by the Google Summer of Code **(GSoC)** 2013, under its umbrella project LLVM. [Mingliang Liu](pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liuml07) from Tsinghua University joined at June directed by Swarup. It's an ongoing project and pull requests are heavily appreciated.

What does _Giri_ mean?
------------------
Here is what John said in the LLVM maillist:
> For the curious, the project is named "giri" because, to the best of my knowlege, this is a Japanese word that means "slice."
