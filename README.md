### Credit

This project was firstly developed by [Swarup Kumar Sahoo](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~ssahoo2/) and [John Criswell](http://www.bigw.org/~jcriswel) under [Vikram S. Adve](http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/~vadve/) from UIUC. It was selected by the Google Summer of Code **(GSoC)** 2013, under its umbrella project LLVM. [Mingliang Liu](http://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liuml07) from Tsinghua University joined at June directed by Swarup.
